                    not connected with the road and have amazing views and the
                    loveable aroma all around the valley. This valley is full of
                    birds and wildlife. Villagers here live here for 6 months
                    and in winters move to lower places with their cattleâ€™s to
                    save them from snow and cold. Houses made up of old
                    traditional way with stone and mud. Earlier this area was
                    under wildlife sanctuary but recently village area removed
                    from wildlife and used as agriculture land.

                      ascents and easy descents. The entire terrain is easy, scenic and
                      doable by all kinds of trekkers. While the first five kilometres
                      of the trek are simple, easy to do and not quite undulating, it is
                      the final kilometre which is steeper than the rest, and requires
                      extra time to trail. During this part of the trek, the trail is
                      steep, and trekkers need to walk sturdily. This stretch of the
                      trek is popularly known as 22 Curves, because of the 22 sharp
                      curves that you get en route. In addition to experiencing stunning
                      views of the forest and snow-capped mountains, you can also visit
                      some nearby places on your trek to Triund. Some of these include
                      the serene Bhagsu Falls, which is a popular sightseeing
                      attraction, known for its gushing white waterfall. The home of the
                      Dalai Lama, the Namgyal Monastery, also falls on the way to
                      Triund, where you can learn a lot about the Tibetan culture and
                      beliefs. You can also pay a visit to the holy Gallu Devi and Guna
                      Devi temples.

            goes through Kareri village and starts through mixed pine and
            broadleaf forests. Birds such as the black drongo and red-billed
            blue magpie are commonly seen. A little care is needed as the
            undergrowth is thick and the ground is littered with pine needles,
            making it a little slippery. After about 15 minutes the trail
            curves upwards towards a metal road. After joining the road, you
            walk along the road for about 10-15 mins until Nolli bridge. The
            trail then curves off just before the bridge. This point is easily
            identifiable by a small shack that sells soft drinks and packaged
            food items. The trail then goes back into the forest.

            of adventure, beauty and a sense of achievement. The exhilaration
            of traversing a 17,457 ft pass is an experience of a lifetime. Pin
            Parvati Pass trek provides the most spectacular traverses, right
            from the forest and verdant meadows of the Parvati Valley to the
            Buddhist villages in the Trans-Himalayan region of Spiti. The
            sharp contrast in landscapes, culture, flora and fauna will catch
            you off-guard. Within hours, youâ€™ll walk from cold dry mountain
            desert region of Spiti to the rich biodiversity in Parvati Valley.
            As you climb higher to Pin Parvati Pass, the birdâ€™s-eye view of
            the Parvati and Pin Valley is fantastic. Pin Parvati has a host of
            unique experiences to offer you: from the pulley bridge at Tunda
            Bhuj to marshlands of Mantalai to alpine meadows of Odi Thach,
            dense forests near Kheerganga and glacier near the Pass. Pin
            Parvati trek builds from cold dry deserts of Spiti and its unique

            greenery, the flowers of Odi Thach hits you harder after days of
            trekking among wind-carved rock formations and glaciers. Near the
            end of trek, you also experience the hot water springs at Parvati
            Kund at Kheerganga. Words cannot describe the experience of a hot
            water bath here after a hard day of trekking.

            Himachal Pradesh. It is a high-altitude trek nestled at 4875 mts above
            sea level. It is an alpine terrain between the Kullu Valley and
            Dharamshala is one of the most spectacular and little-known regions of
            the Western Himalaya. Bara Bhangal trek offers you to witness the
            majestic view of the Dhauladhar and Pin Panjal range. The major
            tourist attractions coming en-route are Lama Dugh, Riyali Thach,
            Kalihani, Devi ki Marhi, Dal Marhi, Marhi, Plachak, Rajgundha. The
            trek that normally begins from the Hidimba Temple in the Manali town
            takes the ascenders across the thick alpine forests to reach the
            campsites of Lamadug. The trail is moderate till Lamadug and then the
            path continues through the Rhododendron and Pine forests to reach the
            next step of camping at Riyali Thach. Then from Riyali Thach, the
            trail goes to the Kalihani Pass at an altitude of 4800 m which is the
            most difficult route that passes through visualizing ice, snow on the
            glacier, and moraines at the valley. One needs to be careful walking
            on the glacier that it can be slippery and fatal. Then one will cross
            the pass and descends a vertical section of snow and glaciers to the
            Donku Thach. After Donku Thach the trail slants along the Kalihani
            river then enter into the wild forests till Dev ki Marhi. From this
            point, the forest accompanies with wild flora and fauna until the
            campsite at Dal Marhi. After a few days of climbing, finally, the trek
            ends at the Bara Bhangal village. Once in Barabhangal, one can explore
            the life of isolated village habitats. Later, the trek descends
            through Plachak, Rajgundha, and then towards Billing which is a famous
            spot for paragliding. From Billing, take a taxi to Dharamshala and
            depart to your preferred destinations. The whole trek takes at least
            10 days.
